        //The following block of code was originally the google geolocation example at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geolocation. I had modified that code to add a marker at the location of the popup. The project requirements call for reverse geolocation, however, to not only center the map at the current location(which this code did before) but also show the current address through reverse geolocation. I took the function geocodeLatLng(geocoder, map, infoWindow) at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-reverse and combined it with the code block that was originally here. Essentially, I took pieces of the reverse geolocation example and modified them to make them work with the geolocation example to make one chunk of code that does both. Things that were not relevant included the function definition itself(the reverse geolocation example was a function geocodeLatLng which was called with the value entered in a text box on the page), and certain variables which served to parse strings. The two examples were not extremely different, so I was able to figure out which parts were already covered, which needed to be removed, and which needed to be added. The resulting code below seems to accomplish geolocation and reverse geolocation! I was not expecting it to work, and even though it does I am nervous because what I had before was a fully completed project(with the exception of displaying the current address) and I moved a lot of stuff around to do this. I will include in my repo a file orig.html which will show what I had before JUST IN CASE this does not end up working on the grader's computer. Orig.html's only functional difference is that it does not display the current user address.
